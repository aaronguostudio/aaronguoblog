## A New Chapter

Lately, what I’ve been thinking about the most is this: **how can I bring about a real, qualitative change in my life**?

Over the past few years, I’ve thrown 200% of my energy into work. Every day felt like a battle, constantly pushing forward. But I’ve come to realize that this kind of single-threaded life simply isn’t sustainable. I’ve neglected my responsibilities at home, missed out on valuable time with loved ones, ignored my own health, and slowly started to operate on autopilot—becoming dull, rigid, and emotionally drained. This isn’t the life I want.

Not long ago, my family went through a difficult period, which forced me to face a tough question: as a son, husband, and father, how well have I really fulfilled my role?

Managing the relationship between my parents and my wife is far from a logical problem with a clear solution. It’s a complex emotional art that requires understanding, patience, empathy, and ongoing communication. During this time, I’ve had to dedicate more mental and emotional energy to navigating this web of relationships. And gradually, I realized: work may actually be the easiest part of my life to control—while family and close relationships are where I still have the most growing to do.

The truth is, as long as you’re reasonably smart and driven, career success is often just a matter of effort. But life isn’t just about your job. What’s truly worth pursuing is not individual achievement, but **systematic balance**—where family, health, career, and personal growth all move forward in harmony.

This reminded me of raising kids. We all know that parenting isn’t just about pouring in time, nor is there one-size-fits-all advice. It requires presence, observation, listening, and guidance—just like crafting a great product. You need breadth of knowledge, depth of vision, and consistency of execution. But most of all, you need to approach it wisely. **With the right mindset, it’s possible to achieve compounding growth even with limited time.**

And I’ve finally realized—I need to apply that same mindset to redesigning my own life.

From today onward, I want to approach every dimension of my life with a new perspective. In this age of AI, it’s no longer just a futuristic idea. It’s already woven into our lives. Instead of grinding along inefficient paths, I want to embrace AI as a powerful lever to **reshape the way I live**:

- Using AI to help me manage my health more scientifically
- Using AI to tackle complex work tasks more efficiently
- Even using AI to improve communication, relationships, and emotional regulation

## Why AI?

As AI continues to evolve, I’ve realized I can **live smarter, not harder**. We’re living in an extraordinary era—AI is no longer just for programmers; it’s becoming an everyday companion in our lives.

And the data backs it up:

- A McKinsey study shows that generative AI could unlock **$2.6 to $4.4 trillion USD** in productivity gains annually—especially for knowledge workers, by automating repetitive and information-heavy tasks.
- A Harvard study found that employees using GPT-4 in complex writing and data analysis tasks saw a **40% increase in accuracy**, halved completion time, and reported significantly higher satisfaction.
- According to a survey by Jobscan, **44% of users** used AI to optimize resumes and prepare for interviews, resulting in an **average 14% salary increase** and better job matches.
- In Japan, an AI emotional coach called _MindEase_ reduced **anxiety by 31%** among high-stress professionals by guiding daily self-awareness and stress management practices.

I believe that **if I intentionally redesign my life with AI and optimize every detail**, I might just be able to: preserve my health, maintain strong family relationships, and still create professional impact—perhaps even more effectively than before.

## My “AI-powered Life Experiment” Begins Today

I’ve decided to give myself a real reset. With the help of AI, I’m going to redesign every key aspect of my life: work, family, health, emotions, cognition.

- Using AI to plan daily meals, rest, and workouts—so I’m not relying on sheer willpower anymore
- Using AI to streamline meetings, writing, and knowledge gathering—so I can get complex tasks done with less time
- Using AI to generate parenting ideas and activities—so I can connect with my child more meaningfully and easily
- Using AI to track emotions, journal, and reflect—so I can stay sharp and self-aware
- Using AI to help me design better systems—and occasionally, more humorous ways to work

My 38th birthday is just around the corner. I don’t want to just blow out candles or drink a little wine. This year, I want to give myself a truly meaningful gift: a full reboot of life.

May the road ahead be one of **clarity, balance, and creativity**.

This blog post is the first step of my “AI-powered Life Redesign” project. I’ll use this space to document the changes I experience, the challenges I encounter, and the breakthroughs—both technical and emotional—that come along the way.

Very soon, I’ll turn 38. Instead of celebrating, I hope this day marks the true beginning of a new life phase. Not just a new way of working, but a new way of living.

May this new chapter be one where I live with more clarity, more balance, and more creative energy.
