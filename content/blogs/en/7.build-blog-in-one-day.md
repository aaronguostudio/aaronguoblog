## Thoughts

Recently, I finally completed something I had been wanting to do for a long time—but kept putting off: **building my own blog**.

I’ve always wanted a space of my own where I could share life experiences, reflect on my work, and document what I’ve learned. Social media is too fast, too fragmented. A blog feels more like a digital notebook—calm, self-owned, and free. Writing here isn’t about chasing traffic; it’s about organizing my thoughts, preserving value, and leaving a trail that my future self can look back on.

## My Experience with AI Tools

Like many others, I was initially excited about the idea of using AI tools to build websites. I tried several popular platforms:

- [**Lovable.dev**](https://lovable.dev): Friendly UI, low learning curve, and you can spin up a decent-looking page in minutes.
- [**V0.dev**](https://v0.dev): Great for quickly generating structured component code, especially when paired with shadcn/ui—it feels very intuitive.

However, I ran into two main issues:

1. **Lack of control over details**: The first draft comes out fast, but if I wanted to tweak layout, adjust typography, or add multi-language support, the process became frustrating. It was often easier to just write the code myself.
2. **Free plan limitations**: I was on the free tier, which meant the code wasn’t persistently saved and I couldn’t iterate freely. This seriously impacted continuity.

So in the end, I decided: **AI can assist my workflow, but the core architecture should be in my hands.**

## My Final Setup: Nuxt + Content Module

After comparing several options, I chose to use [**Nuxt 3**](https://nuxt.com) with the official [@nuxt/content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) module to build my blog. Why?

- Nuxt is a framework I’m already familiar with. It combines Vue’s flexibility with powerful SSR capabilities.
- `@nuxt/content` allows me to write posts in Markdown, use frontmatter metadata, auto-generate TOCs, and get great SEO support out of the box.
- It supports static deployment, making it easy to publish on Vercel or Netlify.
- And in the future, if I want to add search, a recommendation system, multi-language support, or even embed AI-assisted reading—this stack is easy to extend.

Most importantly, this solution gives me **full control over code and styles**, without being boxed in by a platform or a locked template.

## My AI Workflow: Vibe Coding + Augment Code

Although I didn’t stick with AI site builders, I did integrate AI into my development flow.

I chose [**Augment Code**](https://www.augmentcode.com/). It doesn’t generate full pages for me, but instead acts as a **semantic coding assistant** while I work.  
I call this process: **vibe coding**.

It feels more like this:

> “I know I want to adjust this card component’s layout, but I don’t want to handwrite every CSS rule. Can you try a few versions that feel right?”

In this context, AI isn’t some robotic code generator—it’s more like a design-savvy partner who helps explore options. This significantly improves how I control the visual output and makes the building process way more enjoyable.

## Tech is Just a Medium—Expression is the Core

Building a blog isn’t hard. **What’s hard is sticking with it.**

My biggest takeaway during setup was this: **Don’t aim for a perfect launch—just aim to write**. Early on, there’s no need for fancy design or heavy structure. Just get words on the page.

To me, this blog isn’t just a content platform—it’s a long-term system for self-construction.  
It connects my reflections on life, questions I explore while learning, lessons from work—and maybe even seeds of future product ideas.

## Closing Thoughts

From today on, this blog isn’t just a record of my past, but a commitment to my future.

Here, I’ll continue documenting my thoughts and growth—  
on work, on family, on tech, and on life.

Not fancy, just real.  
May it become a consistent part of how I express and evolve.
