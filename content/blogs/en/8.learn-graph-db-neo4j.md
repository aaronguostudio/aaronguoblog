## Introduction

I recently saw they are some discussions about Graph Rag, which seems a powerful way to build knowledge systems. In the meanwhile, during KubeConf 2025, I met the folks at the Neo4j's booth. It's interesting to see how to use Graph DB to solve my problems.

## A Brief Overview of Database Types

Before diving deeper into graph databases like Neo4j, it's helpful to understand the broader landscape of database technologies. Different types of databases are optimized for different kinds of data and access patterns. Here's a quick summary:

### 1. Relational Databases (SQL)

- **Concept:** Stores data in predefined tables with rows and columns. Relationships between tables are explicitly defined using foreign keys. Data integrity is often enforced through schemas and constraints.
- **Use Cases:** Structured data, transactions requiring ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, complex queries involving multiple tables (joins).
- **Query Language:** SQL (Structured Query Language).
- **Representatives:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle Database, SQL Server, SQLite.

### 2. NoSQL Databases (Not Only SQL)

This is a broad category encompassing several models that differ from the traditional relational approach. They often prioritize scalability, performance, and flexibility over the strict consistency of SQL databases.

#### a) Key-Value Stores

- **Concept:** Simplest NoSQL type. Stores data as a collection of key-value pairs. Think of it like a giant dictionary or hash map.
- **Use Cases:** Caching, session management, user profiles, real-time data lookups where access is primarily by key.
- **Representatives:** Redis, Memcached, Amazon DynamoDB (also has document features).

#### b) Document Databases

- **Concept:** Stores data in documents, typically in formats like JSON or BSON. Documents can be nested and don't require a strict, predefined schema for all documents in a collection.
- **Use Cases:** Content management, catalogs, user profiles, applications where data structure evolves frequently.
- **Representatives:** MongoDB, Couchbase, Firestore.

#### c) Column-Family Stores

- **Concept:** Stores data in tables with rows and dynamic columns. Data for a row is stored together by column families, which allows for efficient reads/writes of specific columns across many rows.
- **Use Cases:** Big data applications, logging, data warehousing, systems requiring high write throughput.
- **Representatives:** Apache Cassandra, HBase.

### 3. Graph Databases

- **Concept:** Stores data as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships) connecting those nodes. Both nodes and edges can have properties. Optimized for traversing and querying complex relationships.
- **Use Cases:** Social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection, knowledge graphs, network and IT operations.
- **Query Languages:** Often specific graph query languages like Cypher (Neo4j) or Gremlin (Apache TinkerPop).
- **Representatives:** Neo4j, ArangoDB (multi-model), Amazon Neptune, JanusGraph.

Understanding these different types helps you choose the right tool for the job. Now, let's focus on the unique strengths of **Graph Databases** like Neo4j...
