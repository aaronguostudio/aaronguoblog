## Summary

Several cloud-based headless scraping platforms let you offload Puppeteer or Playwright workloads entirely, so you don't need to run browsers in your own app. Apify's cloud platform offers "Actors" with integrated proxies, scheduling, and storage for large-scale automation ([Apify](https://apify.com)). Browserless.io provides a hosted API for headless Chrome and Playwright with built-in bot-detection evasion ([browserless.io](https://browserless.io)). ScrapingBee is a dedicated scraping API that handles proxies and headless rendering for you ([ScrapingBee](https://scrapingbee.com)). Zyte's Splash engine is exposed via their unified Zyte API, combining JavaScript rendering with anti-ban technology ([zyte.com](https://zyte.com)). PhantomBuster runs your scripts ("Phantoms") in the cloud at scale ([PhantomBuster](https://phantombuster.com)). ScrapingBot offers a fully managed browser-based scraping service to minimize blocks ([scraping-bot.io](https://scraping-bot.io)). Zyte's Scrapy Cloud hosts and orchestrates Scrapy spiders in a serverless cloud environment ([Zyte Scrapy Cloud](https://zyte.com/scrapy-cloud/)). As an alternative, you can deploy headless Chrome in serverless functions on AWS Lambda ([AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)), Azure Functions ([Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/functions/)), or Google Cloud Functions ([Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions)), striking a balance between cost, maintenance, and scale.

## Cloud-Based Headless-Browser Services

### Apify Cloud Platform

Apify is a full-stack cloud platform for web scraping, browser automation, and AI agents, providing ready-made "Actors," proxy management, scheduling, and scalable compute instances via a web UI or API ([Apify](https://apify.com)). You can deploy your Node.js or Python crawlers as serverless Actors, complete with persistent storage and webhooks ([Crawlee JS](https://crawlee.dev/)).

### Browserless.io

Browserless.io offers a hosted headless Chrome and Playwright environment accessible through Docker or a REST API. It supports standard Puppeteer/Playwright workflows, proxy rotation, and CAPTCHA solving, so you can focus on data extraction rather than infrastructure ([browserless.io](https://browserless.io)).

### ScrapingBee

ScrapingBee provides a Web Scraping API that abstracts away proxy management and headless browser orchestration. You send a single HTTP request with your target URL, and ScrapingBee returns the fully rendered HTML or parsed data ([ScrapingBee](https://scrapingbee.com)).

### Zyte API (Splash)

Zyte's Splash engine, now integrated into Zyte API, enables JavaScript-heavy page rendering with advanced anti-ban technology. It offers the same browser-rendering capabilities as Splash but within a unified scraping API that handles retries, proxies, and scheduling ([zyte.com](https://zyte.com)).

### PhantomBuster

PhantomBuster runs custom headless-Chrome scripts ("Phantoms") in the cloud. You write automation steps via their web IDE or API, and PhantomBuster handles scaling, session management, and result delivery ([PhantomBuster](https://phantombuster.com)).

### ScrapingBot

ScrapingBot is a cloud service that executes scraping tasks in real browsers to evade simple anti-bot measures. It provides an API to submit URLs and retrieve structured data, with built-in error recovery and proxy rotation ([scraping-bot.io](https://scraping-bot.io)).

### Scrapy Cloud

Zyte's Scrapy Cloud hosts and monitors your Scrapy spiders with minimal setup. You push your spider code, schedule runs, and manage logs/results via their dashboard. It's like "Heroku for Scrapy," offering automatic scaling and retries ([Zyte Scrapy Cloud](https://zyte.com/scrapy-cloud/)).

## Serverless-Function Alternatives

### AWS Lambda

You can package Puppeteer with headless Chrome in Lambda Layers to run ephemeral browser tasks on demand. This serverless pattern scales automatically and charges only for execution time ([AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)).

### Azure Functions

Azure Functions supports running headless Puppeteer scripts on the Linux Consumption plan. By bundling the proper Chromium binaries, you can execute dynamic page renders without managing servers ([Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/functions/)).

### Google Cloud Functions

Google Cloud Functions (2nd gen) include system packages needed for headless Chrome. Use `puppeteer-core` to minimize deployment size and run JavaScript rendering jobs as short-lived functions ([Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions)).

## Recommendations and Next Steps

- **Quick Start**: Try **Browserless.io** or **ScrapingBee** for minimal code changes and pay-as-you-go pricing.
- **Full-Featured Platform**: Choose **Apify** if you need integrated scheduling, storage, and proxy management alongside headless browsing.
- **Scrapy-centric**: Use **Scrapy Cloud** if your code is already in Scrapy.
- **Custom Control**: Opt for **serverless functions** (AWS Lambda, Azure, or GCP) when you want fine-grained control over dependencies at lower per-execution costs.

By selecting the option that best fits your scale, budget, and maintenance preferences, you can enhance your web scraping capabilities with reliable, up-to-date content without overloading your own infrastructure.
