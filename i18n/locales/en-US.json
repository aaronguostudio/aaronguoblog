By day, I wrangle complex challenges in the investment world; by night (and often weekends!), you'll find me diving deep into the realms of Javascript, Typescript, Vue, and Nuxt, always eager to build something new or solve a tricky puzzle. Welcome to my corner of the web where I share my explorations and insights!"
